# SystemVerilog Modules
A collection of SystemVerilog modules to take with you in your pocket and
learn basic designs of digital electronics
 
## Getting Started
This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow this simple step:

### Installation
_These modules are designed for HDL learning. Once you clone the project, run it in any simulator of your choice._
